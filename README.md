# YouTube Trending Video Analysis

YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform owned by Google. It was launched on February 14, 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is the second most visited website, with more than one billion monthly users who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day. As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.  
 
Content creators on YouTube, commonly known as “YouTubers” are pushing their content every single day and hour to be relevant to their audiences. It’s a known fact that the YouTube algorithm, which recommends videos to the audience searching for a particular topic or videos on the homepage is still not predictable and the YouTube development team has not made any bold claims about this. The trending section is where some top 50-70 videos are listed as trending and it is designed in such a way that every user of this platform checks it once in a while.  
  
This analysis aims to analyse the trending section of YouTube for India and try to conclude some of the trends and observations which could be helpful for creators to push their content to more audiences.
